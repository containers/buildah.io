A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Buildah. There are two methods that can be used to subscribe to it.

1.  Send an email to [buildah-join@lists.buildah.io](mailto: buildah-join@lists.buildah.io?subject=subscribe) with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.
2.  Go to this [page](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/buildah.lists.buildah.io/), then scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" button.

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you. After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to [buildah@lists.buildah.io](mailto: buildah@lists.buildah.io). You can then also go to the list's [web page](https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/buildah@lists.buildah.io/) and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.

Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them [here](https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues) by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
