<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Buildah.  There are two methods that can be used
to subscribe to it.

<ol>
  <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto: buildah-join@lists.buildah.io?subject=subscribe">buildah-join@lists.buildah.io</a> with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.</li>
  <li>Go to this <a href="https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/buildah.lists.buildah.io/">page</a>, then  scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" buton.</li>
</ol>

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you.  After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to <a href="mailto: buildah@lists.buildah.io">buildah@lists.buildah.io</a>.  You can then also go to the list's <a href="https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/buildah@lists.buildah.io/">web page</a> and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.

<p>
Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues">here</a> by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
