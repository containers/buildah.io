# Buildah version 1.12.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of Buildah version 1.12.0 which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora, RHEL 8, RHEL 7, CentOS, openSUSE and Ubuntu in the near future.  Also container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.

## Notable enhancements:
* A new `manifest` command.
* A new `--history` option for the `image` command.
* A new `--device` option has been added to the `bud` and `from` commands.
* Changes to the `--pull` option used by the `bud` and `from` commands.
* Buildah now uses a ‘Containerfile’ by default rather than a ‘Dockerfile’.
<!--readmore-->

This release comprises changes made for v1.11.1, v1.11.2, v1.11.3, v1.11.4, v1.11.5, v1.11.6 and v1.12.0.

## The major highlights of this release are:
* A `manifest` command has been added to allow a Docker manifest list or an OCI image index to be created, updated, inspected, pushed or removed.  See buildah-manifest (1) for more information.
* A `--history` option has been added to the `image` command to show the image name history.
* A `--device` option has been added to the `bud` and `from` commands.  It allows an additional device or devices to be added under a directory in the container.
* The `--pull` option for the `bud` and `from` commands now emulate the Docker functionality.  Also a `--pull-never` option has been added to both commands.  When used, only images in the local storage will be used.
* If the context directory has a file named `Containerfile`, the `bud` command will use that file instead of a file called `Dockerfile`.  If there is no `Containerfile` in the context directory, Buildah will use the `Dockerfile` if it is present.  The internal syntax of both files is the same.
* A number of errors that happened when using the COPY or ADD commands in a Dockerfile have been corrected.

## Release Changes

### Changes within v1.12.0

  * The `ADD` command in a Dockerfile can now use an http reference as the source location.
  * The internal storage opts is now overridden if --storage-driver  is provided.
  * Start using containers/common, this will allow for a single configuration file to be used by all container tools (Podman, Skopeo, Conmon, Buildah, etc.).
  * When the rootfs of a container is unmounted, it now uses MNT_DETACH to unmount everything below it.
  * When binding, less spurious warnings are shown for missing mountpoints.
  * A manifest error during `buildah commit` has been fixed.
  * Added the `--history` option to the `buildah images` command to display the image name history.
  * An error that arose when an equal sign was missing in the --from and --chown flags for COPY/ADD in  a Dockerfile has been corrected.
  * When a Dockerfile COPY uses a URL, it now returns an error as it should.
  * Fixed a .dockerignore exclude regression that caused the functionality to not work if no exclusions were specified.
  * When committing a Docker image, Buildah now always sets the ContainerID and ContainerConfig fields.
  * Added builder identity annotations to container images.
  * Enhanced error verbiage on unsafe symbolic link targets.
  * Added the OCIRuntime field to the `buildah info` output.
  * An appropriate error is returned if a command requires the use of an authfile and it does not exist.
  * When running `buildah bud --quiet` only the imageID is now displayed.
  * Fixed the `--pull` option for `bud` and `from` to emulate the functionality in Docker, also added the `--pull-never` option to both commands which will use only an image on the local storage or fail.
  * Configuration blobs for manifest lists are now handled appropriately.
  * A crash that could occur if an error was raised before the image’s name was established has been corrected.
  * Added a disableFips option to the secrets package.
  * When the Dockerfile had multiple `ADD` commands with a `tar.xz` file as the source, the cache would be reused even if the files in the tar file had changed.  This has been corrected.
  * The default authfile path is now the same as the other container tools which is set by the containers/image project.
  * A `manifest` command has been added to allow the manipulation and viewing of Docker manifest lists or OCI image indices
  * More than one device can be added under the directory using the `--device` option of the `bud` command.
  * The `bud` option now works if the context directory is a git repo.
  * Silence the "using cache" output in the `bud` command to ensure the `--quiet` option is fully quiet.
  * Better error handling has been added to the `commit` when an error is thrown from container/storage.
  * Fixed a crash when an invalid `COPY` --from flag was specified in  a Dockerfile.
  * Fixed an error with --build-args handling when the Dockerfile `COPY` or `ADD` commands used the specified variable.
  * Added support for retrieving context from stdin "-" to the `bud` command.
  * The version of cgroup used by the system is now shown in the `buildah info` command.
  * The build 'STEP' output line now prints to stdout, not stderr.
  * The ‘bud` command now uses a file called ‘Containerfile` by default.
  * Added a `--device` option to the `bud` and `from` commands to allow additional devices to be added.  Reference the man pages for each command for more information.
  * Add support for /run/.containerenv which allows a container process to verify if they are running in a container or not.
  * Image names displayed in the `image` command are truncated to 32 characters.
  * File and directory mount permissions are now set after taking umask into consideration.
  * TMPDIR is now set to /var/tmp by default.
  * Allow mounts.conf entries entries can be simplified if the source and destination are the same path.
  * Labels and annotations now work appropriately for 1-line Dockerfiles.
  * Bump to v1.12.0-dev.
