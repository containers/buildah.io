# Buildah version 1.14.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of Buildah version 1.14.0 which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora, RHEL 8, CentOS, openSUSE and Ubuntu in the near future.  Also container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features a new containers.conf file, added options for the  `bud`, `commit`, `push` and `pull` commands, and many bug fixes.  Notable enhancements:  

* Containers.conf support.  Containers.conf is a way to modify the default ways containers run on the system.  The `/usr/share/containers/containers.conf` and  `/etc/containers/containers.conf` files can now be used by Buildah to attain configuration options.  In the near future Podman, Skopeo and other projects in the Containers repository will make use of these files too.
* A number of performance improvements were made to the `bud` command, especially so when a `.dockerignore` file was in use.
* The `bud` command now accepts `--os` and `--arch` as options. 
* A `--sign-by` option has been added to the `bud`, `commit` and `push` commands.
* A `--remove-signatures` option has been added to the `pull` and`/push` commands.

  * Added codespell support to the builds to catch spelling errors.
  * A number of internal changes were made to tar file handling in the build process to close files at an appropriate time and to not digest files that the process would otherwise ignore.
