# Buildah version 1.18.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.18.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.18.0) which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 32 & 33 and RHEL 8.4.  This will also be shipped on CentOS, openSUSE and Ubuntu in the near future.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features the notable enhancements: Short name aliases for container image names can now be declared and used more securely, the pull policy to use with the `buildah pull` command can now be specified, a few speed improvements to the build process were created, and a number of bug fixes. 

* Short name aliases can now be declared and used in a more secure manner.  For more details see this blog [post](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names).
* The `--policy` option has been added to `buildah pull` allowing the user to specify the pull policy to use when pulling.  The valid values are: missing, always and never.  See (buildah-pull(1)](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/docs/buildah-pull.md) for details.
