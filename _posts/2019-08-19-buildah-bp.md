A new article about how to best run Buildah in a container on the [Red Hat Developer Site](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/08/14/best-practices-for-running-buildah-in-a-container/?sc_cid=701f20000012i69AAA).  In the article {{ author.display_name }} gives a good walkthrough on how you can run Buildah inside of a container and the tradeoffs between security and the speed of processing while doing so.  He also dives into the concept of "additional stores" and how you can make use of them.  All of this is especially useful in a CI/CD system that is constantly building container images.  Check it out!
