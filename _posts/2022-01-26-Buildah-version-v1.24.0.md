# Buildah version 1.24.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.24.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.24.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 34, and Fedora 35  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements: 
<!--readmore -->
 * The `--compression-format` and `compression-level` flags have been added to the `push` command.
 * Several options were added to the `--mount` option for the Containerfile `RUN`  and `run` commands.
 * The `build` `--network` option now supports custom networks.

This release comprises changes made for v1.24.0 and will be included in Podman v4.0.

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.24.0
   * Label modification during a build now mimics Docker behavior.
   * Handle zstd compression when unmarshalling a layer.
   * A bug was fixed in the build that, under particular circumstances, could cause the build to stall.
   * The `--compression-format` and `compression-level` flags have been added to the `push` command.
   * Added the --all-platforms option to "buildah build".
   * Added support for `--mount=type=tmpfs` to the Containerfile `RUN`  and `run` commands to allow mounting volatile memory instead of persistent storage.
   * Added support for persistent caching across builds with --mount=type=cache.
   * Support for  `--mount=type=bind` to the Containerfile `RUN`  and `run` commands.
   * The `from= field` is now a valid option to pass to the `--mount` option for `run`.  This allows images to be used as a source.
   * Add support for host.containers.internal in the /etc/hosts
   * Report ignorefile location when no content is added during a build, and an ignorefile is present.
   * Support has been added for overlayfs paths that contain a colon.
   * Rootless containers users should use additional groups by @rhatdan in #3593
   * USERS specified in a Containerfile can now become members of a supplementary group as specified in a Containerfile.
   * NetworkEnabled is now set appropriately when passed with the `--network` option.
   * Support was added to allow an environment variable to specify the source of a secret for a build command.
   * The image history no longer contains `ARG` values. 
   * The `/sys` file system is no longer mounted if it is not needed.
   * An image’s variant field can now be seen via the `inspect` command or set with the `config` command.
   * The `build` `--network` option now supports custom networks.
   * Output for several errors were changed to show the command output for better debugging.
   * The  `--unsetenv` option was added to the `commit` and `build` commands.
   * The time before closing an ssh connection has been Increased to allow for ssh enough time to close properly.
   * Multiple filters are now accepted by the `images` command.
   * The MediaType in OCI manifests is now set properly.
   * Rootless buildah commands can now set resource limits on cgroup V2.
   * The `--memory-swap` option for the `build` command can be set to `-1` to allow unlimited memory swap.
   * Callers of the `build` command, such as Podman, can now replace the ContainerPrefix with a value of their choosing.
   * Fix default CNI paths so that their value is no longer hardcoded but pulled from the containers.conf file.
   * A number of changes were made to the Cobra CLI calls to make things more consistent for developers and end users.
   * Fixed the  `--platform` option for the `build` command so it appropriately uses the value passed into it.
   * A fix was added to allow the runtime to be searched using a fully qualified path.
   * Added support to specify non-volatile upperdir and workdir for overlay volumes with the Containerfile `RUN`  and `run` commands.
   * The pull commands are now: `--pull`, `--pull=true`, `--pull=false`, `--pull=never`, and `--pull=always`.  Older commands such as `--pull-always` and `--pull-never` are still functional but are no longer documented.

### Overall Miscellaneous Changes  
* Documentation:
   * Added a man page for Containerfile and .containerignore.
   * Updated the `build1 `--platform' option’s compatibility notes.
   * Added example usage for `manifest` on its man page.
   * Fixed the tutorial to correct the `run` command in the ‘Using Containerfiles/Dockerfiles with Buildah’ section.
   * Updates were made to the tutorials to clarify how the `run` command works.
   * Clarifications were added to the `build` command’s `--volume` option.
   * A number of typos and grammatical errors were corrected throughout the man pages.
   * The links for the commands in top-level README.md were corrected.

* Changes to the build infrastructure:
   * Updated the  VM Images and dropped prior-ubuntu testing.
