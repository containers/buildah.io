# Buildah version 1.9 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of Buildah version 1.9 which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora, RHEL 7, CentOS, openSUSE and Ubuntu in the near future.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  A number of changes were made to expedite the building of containers and installing software onto them, a new option has been added for dns handling for `bud` and `from` commands, symbolic link handling in the build process has been corrected, Buildah container images are now available at [quay.io/buildah](https://quay.io/buildah), and more!

<!--readmore-->

This release comprises changes made for v1.8.1, v1.8.2, v1.8.3, v1.8.4 and v1.9.0.

## The major highlights for this release are:
* Support has been added to allow the `bud` command to mount a directory from the host as temporary storage using the Overlay file system which greatly speeds up install procedures.  Reference the “Overlay Volume Mounts” section in the [buildah-bud(1)](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/docs/buildah-bud.md) man page for details.
* A number of changes were made to the cache checking when building an image to help expedite the image building process.
* The `dns` option for the `bud` and `from` commands can now accept the value `none` which disables the creation of `/etc/resolv.conf` in the container.
* A number of issues when a symbolic link was part of a `ADD`, `COPY`, `WORKDIR` and other Dockerfile commands have been resolved.
* A stable, testing and upstream container image are now created per commit to GitHub at [https://quay.io/buildah](https://quay.io/buildah).


## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.9.0
  * Fixed an out of range panic in`buildah run` when a RUN command was used in the Dockerfile. 
  * Bump to v1.9.0-dev

### Changes for v1.8.4 
  * Fixed a hang with `buildah run` when the --isolation=chroot option was used.
  * Removed `-->` that was displayed before the final imageID in the `buildah bud` command.
  * Changed the run code to close stdin pipe appropriately.
  * When doing single user mapping, errors are now printed via logrus.Warnf rather than fprintf. 
  * Removed a number of linux/memfd.h includes to allow for better compilation on older distros.
  * Fixed the handling of symlinks to absolute paths.
  * Only set default network sysctls if not rootless.
  * The --dns option for `bud` and `from` can now accept the value “none” .
  * Create directory paths for the Dockerfile COPY command, thereby ensuring correct permissions for the directories in the container.
  * A number of changes were made to the cache checking when building an image to help expedite the image building process.
  * When an image had multiple tags and the image was already in cache, the additional tags were not applied reapplied to the image.  This has been corrected.
  * Cleanup Overlay Mounts content in the event of a crash.

### Changes for v1.8.3
  * Add support for file secret mounts.
  * Comment lines in the mounts.conf file are now ignored when processing the file rather than causing an error.
  * Changes were made to enable 32bit builds.
  * The fileutils.PatternMatcher is now used when processing a .dockerignore file.
  * The `unshare` command now falls back to single user mapping if setting an unprivileged user namespace fails.
  * If an image’s name ended with `/`, the build process would sometimes drop the ‘/’.  This has been addressed.
  * Before using sysctl, verify first that it exists before using it.
  * To enable rootless podman, the  _CONTAINERS_ROOTLESS_GID environment variable is now set when appropriate.
  * Support has been added for HTTPS git repositories in the build process.
  * Apply the Dockerfile SHELL command appropriately during build time.
  * Environment variables passed into the build process were expanded multiple times, now they are expanded just once to speed up processing.
  * The $HOME environment variable is now set if it had not been set previously, defaulting to `/` if no other value is found.
  * Support has been added for Overlay volumes into the container which greatly speeds up install procedures.  Reference the “Overlay Volume Mounts” section in the [buildah-bud(1)](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/docs/buildah-bud.md) man page.
  * The --shm-size option used by the `from` command was being ignored in rootless processing.  This has been corrected.
  * A number fmt.Printf() statements were moved or removed from the library code to allow for better output to the end user.
  * The algorithm for the history checking in the build process has been made more precise as a full history is now employed during the check.
  * Handle WORKDIR that’s a symlink that points to a dangling target.
  * Help displayed to the user now shows the actual Authfile location as part of the message.
  * The `run` command no longer ignores the `--isolation` option.
  * The build process could error if an image had no layers, this has been corrected.
  * Errors could occur when using the `ADD` command in a Dockerfile and the target was a symlink, this has been corrected.
  * When doing a `commit` or `push` ignore the global signature policy when committing or pushing the image.

### Changelog for v1.8.2
   * Vendor Storage 1.12.6.

### Changes for v1.8.1
  * When creating a directory in a container, don’t error if it already exists.
  * When building images, sometimes an image that would be used later in the process would be removed and would have to be recreated later.  This has been corrected.
  * The `--volumes` option was being ignored by the `bud` command, this has been corrected.
  * Handle WORKDIRs that are symlinks.
  * Changes were made to Buildah to allow the Podman remote client to be built in Windows.
